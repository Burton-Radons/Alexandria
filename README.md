A set of .NET libraries for viewing and processing data, almost totally related to videogames.

The current focus is on From Software's Souls games - Demon Souls, Dark Souls, and Dark Souls 2. I've also got code for working with Sierra AGI files in there, more SSI Gold Box decoded than anyone else (with a pretty useful script visualiser), Unreal, Nintendo DS games, I've got old code to port in for Ultima and Ultima II-IX, Ultima Underworld and Ultima Underworld II and System Shock, Morrowind, Outcast, Albion, and others... I do this a lot. This is the project to bring this all together in one great big plugin-oriented monster.

The core idea is to abstract as much of a game's data as possible, to make it easier to visualise and modify it so that you can get through those parts easy and concentrate on the much more complex game-specific issues. Secondary to that is making it easy to write new plugins and processors; once you have Visual Studio 2012 Express installed, a new plugin shouldn't be much more difficult than writing a Python script. Ideally this is supported with an API that is well-documented, comprehensible, and has lots of tools for making processing data easy. This ideal varies in how well it's implemented, but that's the goal.

Some of the information I find are brought together in a file format wiki I maintain (https://sites.google.com/site/fileformats/). This is kept separate in order for it to be more useful to other projects.
